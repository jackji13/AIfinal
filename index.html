        <p class="text">
            Artificial Intelligence plays an increasingly significant role in our 
            lives, yet its "Black Box" nature often leaves people in the dark about how 
            it works or the biases it may perpetuate. This lack of transparency undermines 
            trust, accountability, and fairness, disproportionately impacting marginalized 
            communities.  
            <br>
            <br>
            Our website seeks to break the Black Box of AI by making its complexities 
            accessible through interactive visuals and engaging animations. By revealing 
            how AI systems process data, make decisions, and can be influenced by biases, 
            we aim to empower users to critically understand and question these technologies, 
            fostering a more informed and equitable society.

            <p>AI systems work by learning patterns from data to make predictions or decisions. Hereâ€™s a simple breakdown:</p>
            <p>1. <strong>Data Collection</strong>: AI learns from datasets like text, images, or videos. The quality of this data affects accuracy and fairness.</p>
            <p>2. <strong>Training the Model</strong>: The system adjusts itself through repeated learning to minimize errors over time.</p>
            <p>3. <strong>Making Predictions</strong>: Once trained, AI analyzes new data to provide results, like classifying images or generating responses.</p>
            <p>4. <strong>Feedback Loop</strong>: User interactions improve the system by refining its predictions.</p>
            <p>5. <strong>Transparency and Bias</strong>: Many AI models function as "Black Boxes," making it hard to understand their decisions or identify biases.</p>
            <p>Understanding these steps helps us break the "Black Box" and create AI systems that are fair, transparent, and accountable.</p>
