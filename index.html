            Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays an increasingly significant role in our 
            lives, yet its "Black Box" nature often leaves people in the dark about how 
            it works or the biases it may perpetuate. This lack of transparency undermines 
            trust, accountability, and fairness, disproportionately impacting marginalized 
            communities.  
            <br>
            <br>
            Our website seeks to break the Black Box of AI by making its complexities 
            accessible through interactive visuals and engaging animations. By revealing 
            how AI systems process data, make decisions, and can be influenced by biases, 
            we aim to empower users to critically understand and question these technologies, 
            fostering a more informed and equitable society.
