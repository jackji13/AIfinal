        <p>
            ChatGPT works like a super-smart assistant that understands and responds to your questions. 
            When you type something, your words are turned into numbers that the system can process. 
            These numbers are sent through layers of "thinking" steps called neural networks. Each layer 
            looks for patterns and meaning in your input, like figuring out what you're asking and what makes sense to say next. 
            ChatGPT is trained on a lot of information from books, websites, and conversations, so it can use that knowledge 
            to give you a helpful answer. Finally, the system quickly puts together a clear response for you to read, making it 
            feel like youâ€™re talking to a person who really gets your question.
